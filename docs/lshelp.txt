Usage: lsf [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default) in a "fancified" manner.
Prints directories first if -U or --unsorted is not specified.
Color is not printed if stdout is not a tty.

Arguments range from visual preferences to sorting or information to display on files.
     -a, --all                 do not ignore entries starting with `.`
     -f, --full                acts as the same as `-a` or `--all`
     -A, --almost-all          prints dot files but excludes `.` and `..`
     -d, --dot-dirs            does not exclude `.` and `..` using this with `-A` or `--almost-all`
                               will act as `-f` or `-a`

     -U, --unsorted            does separate the printing of directories and regular files.

     -hr, --human-readable     specifies how to display file size: `none`, `bytes`, `binary`, or `si`
                               defaults to `none`, and also does not display size of directories.
                               the number value in code can be specified as well.
                               (e.g: 0=none, 1=bytes, 2=binary, 3=si)
     -hr=x, --human-readable=x
                               same as `-hr` or `--human-readable` but in one argument and
                               only takes number value
     -c, --dir-contents        when cmobined with `-hr` or `--human-readable`, lists the size of every file
                               in a directory added together.
