# **C**ore**u**tils fanci**fied** (Cu-fied)

Cu-fied (_pronounced /kjufaÉªd/_ ) is a rewrite of [GNU's Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) to focus on being "fancified" rather than being machine-readable.
(Fancier in my subjective opinion.)

## Building from source

First off, it is primarily designed for the x86 and ARM platforms of linux and macOS. It most definitely will not work on Windows due to using `unistd.h` and some specific posix functions; However, WSL and Cygwin _might_ work. Supporting Windows is not on the roadmap, although PRs to improve cross-platform compatibility are welcome.

With that out of the way, you only need these dependencies:

- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) 0.15.1 or later.
- [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl) installed via a system package manager.
  (Note that it is planned to statically link cURL if it is not installed globally.)
